## Lesson 1: Introduction to Blockchain and Essential Tools
In our first session, we explore the core concepts of blockchain technology, emphasizing decentralization and consensus. We introduce essential tools like MetaMask for managing cryptocurrency transactions and interacting with Ethereum, as well as Solidity and Remix for smart contract development.

## Lesson 2: Solidity Syntax Fundamentals
In the [second lesson](https://github.com/ScipioneParmigiano/Start-Contract/tree/main/lesson_2) of our course, we delved into the fundamental syntax of Solidity through a hands-on approach. Participants actively engage in writing two essential contracts: SimpleStorage and FundMe. 
The SimpleStorage contract provide an introduction to basic data storage within Solidity, emphasizing the pivotal role of variables and their manipulation. Meanwhile, the FundMe contract introduce the concept of managing financial transactions securely on the blockchain, showcasing the language's ability to handle complex financial logic. 
Through interactive exercises and real-time coding, students not only graspe the intricacies of Solidity syntax but also gain practical experience in crafting functional smart contracts. This initial session set the stage for further exploration into advanced Solidity concepts.

## Lesson 3: Oracles and Off-chain Data

## Lesson 4: Solidity Token Engineering

## Lesson 5: Front-End Integration with Smart Contracts
