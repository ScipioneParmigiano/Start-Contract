## Lesson 1: Introduction to Blockchain and Essential Tools
In our first session, we explore the core concepts of blockchain technology, emphasizing decentralization and consensus. We introduce essential tools like MetaMask for managing cryptocurrency transactions and interacting with Ethereum, as well as Solidity and Remix for smart contract development.

## Lesson 2: Solidity Syntax Fundamentals
In the [second lesson](https://github.com/ScipioneParmigiano/Start-Contract/tree/main/lesson_2) of our course, we delved into the fundamental syntax of Solidity through a hands-on approach. Participants actively engage in writing two essential contracts: SimpleStorage and FundMe. 
The SimpleStorage contract provide an introduction to basic data storage within Solidity, emphasizing the pivotal role of variables and their manipulation. Meanwhile, the FundMe contract introduce the concept of managing financial transactions securely on the blockchain, showcasing the language's ability to handle complex financial logic. 
Through interactive exercises and real-time coding, students not only graspe the intricacies of Solidity syntax but also gain practical experience in crafting functional smart contracts. This initial session set the stage for further exploration into advanced Solidity concepts.

## Lesson 3: Oracles and Off-chain Data
In this lesson, we will explore the concept of oracles, focusing on the mechanisms involved in obtaining Ethereum price data and utilizing Verifiable Random Function (VRF) on the blockchain.

## Lesson 4: Solidity Token Engineering

The lesson starts by introducing the fundamental concepts of tokens within Ethereum, highlighting ERC20's role in handling fungible tokens like cryptocurrencies and utility tokens. It then progresses to explain ERC721 and its unique capabilities for representing non-fungible assets such as digital collectibles and real-world items.

Tokenization principles are explored to showcase how assets can be represented as tokens on the blockchain, enabling fractional ownership and increased liquidity. Moreover, learners delve into the integration of IPFS, a decentralized file storage protocol, to store token-related metadata and assets off-chain while ensuring accessibility and immutability.
